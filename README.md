# Book-Genre-Prediction-from-Book-Summary
Books are often judged by their cover or title, leading to misleading genre assumptions once the content is revealed. Developed an automated system to accurately classify book genres from the book's synopsis using machine learning models. Applied text preprocessing techniques (cleaning, lemmatization, TF-IDF vectorization with bi-grams) for feature extraction. Achieved accuracy of 78% (Logistic Regression), 77% (SVM), and 69% (Random Forest) after hyperparameter tuning.
