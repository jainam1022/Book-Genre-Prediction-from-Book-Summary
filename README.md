# Book-Genre-Prediction-from-Book-Summary
Develop an automated system to accurately classify book genres from the book's synopsis using machine learning models. Applied text preprocessing techniques (cleaning, lemmatization, TF-IDF vectorization with bi-grams) for feature extraction. Achieved accuracy of 78% (Logistic Regression), 77% (SVM), and 69% (Random Forest) after hyperparameter tuning.
